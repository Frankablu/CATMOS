The CATMOS prototype is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Frankablu/CATMOS">git hub here</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>Installation Instructions:</b><br>
<br>

The CATMOS tool was developed as a research prototype and makes <br> use of a large number of dependencies that need to be installed first. <br>
<br>
CATMOS is split into a client component and a server component. <br>
<br>
The server component is used performing the computational expensive <br> runs and can be run on different computer to 
the client which is used for controlling the tool. <br>
<br>
1. Download the latest release of the CATMOS tool here: <a href="https://github.com/Frankablu/CATMOS/releases"><b>Download link</b></a><br>
<br>
<b>Windows Install Instructions: </b><br>
<br>
2. Install SWI-Prolog from <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html">http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html</a><br>
3. Run catmos_server.exe to start the backend process <br>
It will listen on port 11100 by default. <br>
You can call the program with an argument such as catmos_server.exe 11101 to change the listening port number <br>
to run multiple copies of the server process. Each process is single threaded but multiple copies can be used <br>
together to make use of multiple core processors. <br>
<br>
Now follow Client Install Instructions below. <br>
<br>
<b>Linux/Unix/Mac OS X Install Instructions </b><br>
2. Install SWI-Prolog, Boost, Lua, gcc & Make using your package manager. <br>
<br>
Examples: <br>
<b>Archlinux: </b> pacman -S swi-prolog boost lua gcc make <br>
<br>
<b>Mac OS X: <a href="https://www.macports.org">Via Macports: </a></b> port install swi-prolog boost lua <br>
Install the Xcode Command Line Tools<br>
<br>
3. Enter the catmos_server directory via the command line and run: <br>
su<br>
make && make install<br>
<br>
catmos_server or catmos_server portNumber starts the server process. <br>
To use multiple cores you need to start multiple processes on different port numbers. <br>
<br>
<b>Client Install Instructions:</b><br>
<br>
The client install is the same for Windows, Linux & Mac OS X. <br>
<br>
Download and install Eclipse Epsilon from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/">http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/</a> <br>
<br>
<b>4. Run Eclipse Epsilon and point the workspace to the catmos_gui directory.</b> <br>
<br>
<b>5. Install the XText component. </b><br>
On the Menu Bar: Help > Install Modelling Components > XText <br>
<br>
<b>6. Click on the Green Circle with White Arrow on the toolbar and select Load Tool. </b><br>
<br>
<b>7. Click on the Green Circle with White Arrow on the toolbar and select Run Configurations. </b>
Now select runTool > Models > scenario > Edit > Model File: > Point this to the example you wish to run i.e. /AutoNextReleaseProblem/AutoNextReleaseProblem.scen > Ok > Run <br>
<br>
<b>8. Click on the Green Circle with White Arrow on the toolbar and select getParetoFront to retrieve the Pareto front.</b><br>
The results will be in the folder called Results/ from where the .scen file was loaded <br>
In this example: /AutoNextReleaseProblem/Results/ <br>
<br>
<b>9. Network settings such as running on multiple processes can be accessed by editing Tool > networkSettings.eol</b><br>
getAddress & getPort need to be set to a server process. <br>
preamble is used to tell the server process to connect to other server processes (See comments for example) <br>
